\par
The Large Hadron Collider has been in operation since 2008. 
Since its inception the Higgs was found and numerous Standard Model measurements were made.
Among these measurements was the $W^+W^-$ cross-section which showed a level of disagreement above other electro weak processes for both CMS and ATLAS experiments. 


\par
This thesis describes the measurement of the $W^+W^-$ cross-section using using data collected with the CMS detector. 
The measurement was carried out using a Random Forest classifier as opposed to standard analysis technique which rely heavily on jet multiplicity cuts to remove major backgrounds. 
These cuts lead to hard to calculate log correction factors which could be the cause of the discrepancies. 
We present the measurement of the WW→2l2nu cross-section without strict jet multiplicity cuts, relying instead on a set of Random Forest Classifiers. 
With this technique we measure the pp→WW→2l2nu cross-section.

% If there is an introduction it must be the first chapter

%				% IMPORTANT: If your chapter heading consists
%				% of more than one lines, it will be auto-
%	... text ...		% matically broken into separate lines.
%				% However, if you don't like the way LaTeX
%				% breaks the chapter heading into lines, use
%\section{Another section}	% `\newheadline' command to break lines.
%				% Never use \\ in sectional (e.g., chapter,

% Alternatively, you may write the chapters in separate
% files, say chap1.tex, chap2.tex, etc., and include them 
% with commands:

%\include{chap1}

%\include{chap2}

% The command \includeonly above allows to include a selected 
% set of chapters only.

% Uncomment the 'singlespace' environment and '\bibsep' command
% if needed - some bibliographic styles overide the definition
% of 'thebibliography' in nuthesis.cls
%
\begin{singlespace}
%\bibsep 12pt
\clearpage\phantomsection % needed for hyperlikns to work correctly
\begin{thebibliography}{xxx}

\bibitem{label1} A bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.  A
bibliographic item.  A bibliographic item.
\bibitem{label2} Another bibliographic item.  
\bibitem{label3} Yet another bibliographic item.  
% The usages of \bibitem and \cite{..} are 
% explained in Section 4.3 (page 73) of % LaTeX manual.
% Or you may use BibTeX.
\end{thebibliography}

% (The following suggested by Francisco Iacobelli - 5/11/2010)
% In case, you want to use BibTeX, you should replace (or comment)
% the bibliography environment.
% Instead uncomment the following lines and replace <bib file>

% \begin{singlespace}
% \bibsep 12pt
% \bibliographystyle{acm} %or another suitable style.
